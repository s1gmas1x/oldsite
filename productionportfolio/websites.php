              <p>This website was for a class that I had in college. The class focused mostly on design, color was particularly focused on early in the class. The class was five and a half weeks long. The main project was a majority of the work in the class, and approval from the instructor was required about the type of website being done, including approval for some design elements.  Each week the main project assignments included: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>An image of some kind created in either Photoshop or Illustrator, this image had different requirements each week.. </li><br>
                <li>Five written pages, not including the reference page. This usually had something to do with some aspect of the design in the site, fonts and colors used, site map etc.</li><br>
                <li>Some sort of work done building the site itself. This was different each week, for example, one week the individual pages were required, another week the navigation had to work and so forth. </li><br>
              
              </ul>
				  <p>I was working managing a restaurant at the time, so roughly 40 to 45 hours a week of some pretty physical labor. This made the class a little stressful, but the site was a lot of fun to build. I landed on my color scheme of the purples and blues, and created the first image (the planet background featured on the home page). The idea to go with a sci-fi theme came up pretty early, it seemed to fit the work that had been done up to that point, after that, the rest sort of came together. Bootstrap was used to make everything responsive. At the time the idea of having the navigation actually collapse and stack as the screen got smaller instead of just using a hamburger menu like most mobile versions of websites sounded really cool. The navigation ends up taking up too much space when viewed on a phone though, so it’s really not as cool as I had thought it would be. The text on the site was written very quickly as there were no requirements for this as long as it wasn’t lorem ipsum text and was complete sentences, so some of the content comes across a bit poorly composed, at least to me. </p>
                <p>This website uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, and Bootstrap. There is no database, PHP, or SQL being used so the forms don’t work. </p>
